## 🚨 The 90-Day Vulnerability Gap Crisis

Enterprises face a critical cybersecurity gap: the average time between a new threat's discovery and its official CVE publication in the National Vulnerability Database (NVD) is **90 days**.  
During this window, organizations remain **blind to zero-day exploits**, leaving them dangerously exposed to attacks.

### ⚠️ Key Problems

1. **Delayed CVE Assignment**  
   Zero-day threats circulate for months before receiving official CVE identifiers, rendering traditional CVE-based security tools ineffective during the most critical phase.

2. **Manual Analysis Overhead**  
   Security analysts spend countless hours correlating indicators, researching vulnerabilities, and creating remediation strategies — time that attackers exploit.

3. **Privacy Concerns**  
   Cloud-based AI tools send sensitive browsing and threat data to external servers, introducing compliance and privacy risks for enterprises.

4. **Fragmented Intelligence**  
   Security teams lack a unified platform that merges real-time threat detection, CVE intelligence, and actionable remediation insights.
