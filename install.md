### Backend Services

**⚠️ IMPORTANT: What Makes SOC-CERT Unique**

**Without n8n Backend = Just Another Basic Extension**

- Gemini Nano provides fast local analysis and risk scoring
- Basic threat detection (what many extensions do)
- Limited to AI analysis only

**With n8n Backend = Enterprise-Grade Threat Intelligence**

- **Real CVE Correlation** with CISA KEV Catalog (1400+ CVEs)
- **Virtual CVE Generation** for zero-day threats
- **Hybrid AI Architecture** (local speed + server intelligence)
- **SOC Operations Center** functionality in your browser

**The extension is powerful with local AI, but the n8n backend transforms it from a "nice tool" into an "enterprise security solution".**

The extension has two analysis levels:

1. **Local AI Analysis** (Always Available - Basic Security Tool)

   - Instant threat detection with Gemini Nano
   - Risk scoring and basic recommendations
   - Works offline and immediately

2. **Deep CVE Intelligence** (Requires n8n - Enterprise Security Solution)
   - Real CVE correlation with CISA KEV Catalog
   - Virtual CVE generation for emerging threats
   - Background enrichment via n8n workflows
   - SOC-grade threat intelligence

**For Full Testing Experience:**

- Local AI analysis works immediately after installation
- CVE correlation requires the n8n workflow to be running
- See `n8n-workflows/` folder for workflow setup instructions

**Quick Test (Basic Tool):**

- Visit test domains above
- See instant AI analysis and risk scoring
- Experience basic threat detection

**Full Test (Enterprise Solution):**

- Set up n8n workflow from `n8n-workflows/` folder
- Get real CVE correlations and virtual CVE generation
- Experience SOC-CERT's unique hybrid AI architecture

## 🛠 Troubleshooting

### ❌ "AI APIs not available"

**Solution:** Enable Chrome flags above

**Fallback:** Mock system provides full demo experience

### ❌ No CVE information showing

**Cause:** CVE correlation requires n8n workflow setup

**Solution:**

1. Install n8n: `npm install -g n8n`
2. Follow setup instructions in `n8n-workflows/README.md`
3. Start n8n: `n8n start`
4. Test extension again - CVE data should now appear

**Note:** Local AI analysis works without n8n, but CVE features require the workflow.

### ❌ Extension not loading

- Check console in `chrome://extensions/`
- Ensure all files are in `extension/` folder

### ❌ No security overlay

- Verify domain is in test list above (any page within the domain will trigger detection)
- Check content scripts in extension details

## 📊 Verification Checklist

**Basic Functionality (No Setup Required):**

- ✅ Extension loads without errors
- ✅ Red overlay appears on test URLs
- ✅ Popup shows detailed AI analysis
- ✅ Risk scoring and recommendations work

**Check DevTools Console for Detailed Logs:**

Open Chrome DevTools (`F12` or `Right-click → Inspect`) and verify:

- ✅ **Popup shows detailed analysis** - Check for analysis results in console
- ✅ **CVE information displays correctly** - Verify CVE data in network tab
- ✅ **AI recommendations are generated** - Look for recommendation logs

**Advanced Features (Requires n8n - What Makes SOC-CERT Enterprise-Grade):**

- 🔄 **Real CVE Correlation** with CISA KEV Catalog (after n8n setup)
- 🔄 **Virtual CVE Generation** for emerging threats (after n8n setup)
- 🔄 **SOC Operations Center** functionality (after n8n setup)

**Without n8n = Nice AI Tool. With n8n = Enterprise Security Solution.**

### AI Analysis Behavior

The extension uses Chrome's built-in Gemini Nano AI for threat detection:

- **Background Analysis:** Attempts quick analysis in the service worker for fast detection on all sites
- **Fallback to Tab Analysis:** If background fails or times out, analyzes directly in the page content script
- **Detection Threshold:** Shows overlay for riskScore > 60 (high-confidence threats)
- **Timeout Protection:** 60-second timeout on background analysis to prevent hanging

No API keys required - uses Chrome's native AI capabilities.

## 🤖 Chrome AI APIs Usage

This extension leverages multiple Chrome built-in AI APIs powered by Gemini Nano to provide comprehensive threat detection and analysis. Here's how each API is used:

### 🔍 LanguageModel API (Prompt API)

**Location:** `extension/ai-helper.js` - `analyzeThreat()` function  
**Purpose:** Core threat analysis engine

- Analyzes URLs and page context for security risks
- Generates risk scores, threat types, and indicators
- Provides detailed security recommendations
- **Status:** ✅ Fully implemented and operational

### 📝 Summarizer API

**Location:** `extension/ai-helper.js` - `analyzeCompleteFlow()` function  
**Purpose:** Creates concise security summaries

- Generates key-point summaries of threat analysis
- Provides executive-level security overviews
- **Status:** 🔄 Attempted with fallback to mock system

### ✍️ Writer API

**Location:** `extension/ai-helper.js` - `analyzeCompleteFlow()` function  
**Purpose:** Generates detailed security recommendations

- Creates comprehensive remediation steps
- Produces formal security guidance
- **Status:** 🔄 Attempted with fallback to mock system

### 🌐 Translator API

**Location:** `extension/ai-helper.js` - `analyzeCompleteFlow()` function  
**Purpose:** Multi-language security support

- Translates analysis results for international users
- Provides localized security recommendations
- **Status:** 🔄 Attempted with fallback to mock system

### 📝 Proofreader API

**Location:** `extension/ai-helper.js` - `analyzeCompleteFlow()` function  
**Purpose:** Quality assurance for analysis text

- Improves clarity and professionalism of security reports
- Ensures technical accuracy in recommendations
- **Status:** 🔄 Attempted with fallback to mock system

### 🎯 API Integration Architecture

**Primary Analysis Flow:**

1. **LanguageModel API** performs initial threat assessment
2. **Background processing** attempts to use specialized APIs for enhanced analysis
3. **Fallback system** ensures functionality even when specialized APIs are unavailable
4. **Progressive enhancement** provides basic analysis immediately, with advanced features loading asynchronously

**Fallback Behavior:**

- If specialized APIs are not available, the extension uses intelligent mock implementations
- All core functionality remains available regardless of API availability
- Users get full security analysis experience with or without advanced AI features

**Technical Implementation:**

- APIs are accessed via `window.ai` and `window.LanguageModel` objects
- Service worker handles background analysis for performance
- Content scripts manage page-level detection and overlays
- Robust error handling ensures extension stability

This multi-API approach demonstrates advanced integration of Chrome's AI capabilities for comprehensive cybersecurity analysis.

## 💬 Development Feedback on Chrome AI APIs
